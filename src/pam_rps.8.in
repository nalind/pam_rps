.SH NAME
pam_rps \- challenge-response authentication

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auth required pam_rps.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_rps.so is designed to provide an easy-to-test challenge-response
authentication mechanism for PAM-enabled applications.

Without pam_rps, successful authentication can only occur for a user if the
user has previously established some sort of means of authenticating to the
local system or a trusted server.  Using pam_rps removes this limitation.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP debug
Enable module debugging.  The module will log its progress to syslog with
"debug" priority.

.IP best_of=\fInumber\fP
The user will be issued multiple challenges, and must "win" against more than
one half of them.  If the supplied number is not odd, it will be incremented.

.IP echo
Signal to the calling application that the user should be able to see
the response as it is being typed in.

.IP sun
Follow the conversation conventions consistent with Solaris PAM and not
Linux-PAM.  The default is to attempt to accomodate both.

.IP linux
